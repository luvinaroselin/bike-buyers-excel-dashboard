# bike-buyers-excel-dashboard
Excel dashboard project using the Bike Buyers dataset
I started by cleaning and transforming the dataâ€”replacing inconsistent values, creating calculated columns, and grouping age into categories for better segmentation. Then, I used pivot tables, slicers, and pivot charts to explore trends and build a clean, interactive dashboard.

Key findings:

Bike owners have a higher average income than non-owners

Men earn more than women across both ownership groups

Middle-aged customers show the highest bike ownership rates

People commuting just 1 mile are more likely to own a bike than those traveling over 5 miles
